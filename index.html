            <h3>From Chroma Studio to the virtual Presentation</h3>
            <p>A Chroma studio set is a studio built with a neutral background, which enables the production to control
                and manipulate the graphic aspect of it in real time. </p>
            <p>In the virtual studio set you can use the camera to move in the 3D virtual space, meaning that the
                virtual
                scene can adapt to camera settings for functions like zooming, pan, angle among others. </p>
